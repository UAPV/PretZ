Description
---------------------------------------
Different levels for users : person who lends is a "gestionnaire" and person who lends and can change database (ie access admin page) is an "admin".


PretZ contains two parts :

	1.FRONTEND

		- apps/frontend/modules/default
            -> Customize error pages due to rights access

		- apps/frontend/modules/utilisateur
		    -> If you have right to access this page (can be limited to IP addresses by the admin), you can login via LDAP or you can scan a library card.
		    (To change validation of these cards, go to "users.js") to borrow a product.

        - apps/frontend/modules/emprunt
	        -> If you are "gestionnaire", you can access to this page. This page uses a refresh function (check in the database if a person want to borrow).
	        This page uses much ajax you can see here "web/js/emprunt.js".
	        This module is the hardest of all because it contains much ajax and much features like "scan a product","add user if he can't be logged by CAS", "return a product" and so on.

        - apps/frontend/modules/stat
            -> Module to display statistics as number of lends. You can choice it by product or category with a historic.
                Use of Jqplot (plugin of JQuery). You must install it to display graphics.

        - apps/frontend/modules/materiel
            -> List of materiel to display for users with products available or not. You have any javascript here.



    2.BACKEND

    - "category","product", "service" are modules directly created by Symfony. It's forms to add, delete or edit each item. However a thing has been added : you can print or see barcode of products.

    - "list" : allow to register a student on a list of an employee. A product can be borrowed by a student only if it doesn't need a "referant" (indicated during creating of product). In this part, you can add students on a list or delete a list.

    - "main" : home of backend with actions you can do in this part. You can also print all barcode directly.

    - "option" : here, you can add a new template and named it. You can also see and add ip addresses which can access to PretZ pages. Lastly you can activate option auto mail. If a person borrows a product with a "referant", an email is sent
     to this person or service.

    - "administrator" : add or delete rights to a person.


---------------------------------------
How to personalize ?
---------------------------------------

    First, get to backend and frontend/config/app.yml to change LDAP and CAS addresses. In this file, you can change SMTP address and port.
    You've got many options to disable like "ip addresses adding", "new template creating" or "auto email sending". Theses options can be a update in app/backend/modules/options/templates/indexSuccess.php
